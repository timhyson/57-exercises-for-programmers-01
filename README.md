## Exercise 1 - Saying Hello

The 'Hello, World' program is the first program you learn to write in many languages, but it doesn't involve any input.

So create a program that prompts for your name and rints a greeting using your name.

###Example Output

What is your name? Brian
Hello, Brian, nice to meet you!
